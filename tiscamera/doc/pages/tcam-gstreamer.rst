The Imaging Source Gstreamer Plugins
####################################

The following plugins are offered by us.
When an element property is also available through the property interface its name in said interface will be explicitly listed as "PI: property-name".

.. _tcammainsrc:

tcammainsrc
###########

Source element that retrieves images from a device.  
The tcammainsrc existed as `tcamsrc` prior to tiscamera 0.13.0.  
It is used for v4l2, aravis and libusb devices.

.. list-table:: tcamsrc properties
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 10 65

   * - fieldname
     - type
     - description
   * - serial
     - string
     - Serial number of the device that shall be used
   * - type
     - string
     - Backend the camera shall use. Available options: v4l2, aravis, libusb, unknown
   * - camera-buffers
     - int
     - Number of internal buffers the backend can use.
   * - num-buffers
     - int
     - Only send the specified number of images.
       With 'num-buffers=200' tcamsrc will automatically send an EOS and stop the device after 200 buffers have been sent to the pipeline.
   * - drop-incomplete-buffer
     - bool
     - When incomplete buffers should be delivered this has to be set to `false`.
   * - property-state
     - string
     - JSON string describing the state of all device properties. See :any:`state`.

MetaData
--------

Each image buffer the tcamsrc send has associated meta data that contains multiple information concerning the buffer.

The meta object contains a GstStructure which contains all information. This is to ensure extensibility without interfering with user applications.

The following fields are available:
                        
.. list-table:: GstTcamMeta fields
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10 70
                                                               
   * - fieldname
     - type
     - description
   * - frame_count
     - uint64
     - number of frames delivered. Starts at 0 with every stream start.
   * - frames_dropped
     - uint64
     - number of frames dropped by backend
   * - capture_time_ns
     - uint64
     - Timestamp in Nanoseconds when the backend received the image
   * - camera_time_ns
     - uint64
     - Timestamp when the device itself captured the image. Only useful for GigE.
   * - framerate
     - double
     - framerate the backend has.
   * - is_damaged
     - bool
     - Flag noting if the buffer is damaged in any way. Only useful when drop-incomplete-buffer=false.
       
For timestamp point of reference values look :any:`timestamps`.
Please be aware that not all GStreamer elements correctly pass GstMeta information through.  
Elements like `bayer2rgb` to not copy the meta information.  
This may affect your usage of elements like `tcambin` as they can use such elements internally.

Messages
--------

The tcammainsrc element can send multiple possible messages to the GstBus.
It is generally recommended to listen for error messages as these will be considered lethal to the video stream and cause a stream stop.

Device lost
^^^^^^^^^^^

An error message containing the string "Device lost" will always be sent when the device does not respond or is not reachable.

The received message will be in the format "Device lost (<SERIAL>)".
For an example of message handling, see the example `09-device-lost`.

.. note:: The following requires GStreamer >= 1.10

To simplify error handling the tcamsrc sends an additional "Device lost" message
with a GstStructure attached. This structure contains the string field "serial".
This implies tiscamera was compiled with gstreamer >= 1.10.

.. code-block:: c

   /* This code only works when using gstreamer version 1.10 or higher */
   GstStructure* struc = gst_message_parse_error_details(message);
   const char* lost_serial = gst_structure_get_string(struc, "serial");

.. _tcampimipisrc:

     - True
     - Iris Auto
   * - brightness-reference
     - Image brightness that shall be considered ideal.
       The auto algorithm will try to get within a certain range of this value and adjust exposure/gain to remain within the range. The range is +/- 5 of the brightness reference value.
       Minimum: 0
       Maximum: 255
     - 128
     - Brightness Reference
   * - exposure-min
     - Minimum Exposure Value the element is allowed to set.
       If the user defined value is lower than the camera internal value the camera minimum will be used.

     - Minimum of the camera
     - Exposure Auto Min
   * - exposure-max
     - Maximum Exposure Value the element is allowed to set.
       If the user defined value is higher than the camera internal maximum the camera maximum will be used.
       If the user defined value is higher than the value that is possible with the current framerate the value will be set. **This can cause problems.**
       Default: Highest value the framerate allows i.e. 30 fps => 1000000 / (30 / 1) = 33333.3
       This is a maximum exposure time of 33333 micro seconds.
     - Maximum of the camera / Exposure time the format allows
     - Exposure Auto Max
   * - gain-min
     - Minimum Gain Value the element is allowed to set.
       If the user defined value is lower than the camera internal value the camera minimum will be used.

     - Maximum Gain Value the element is allowed to set.
     - Maximum of the camera
     - Gain Auto Max
   * - iris-min
     - Minimum iris value the element is allowed to set.
       Some cameras suggest a minimum value for auto algorithms that is higher than the actual minimal value. This value will be used when available.
     - Minimum value of the camera.

   * - iris-max
     - Maximum iris value the element is to set.
     - Maximum of the camera.
     - Iris Auto Max
     
The following properties are related to the region of interest.
The region of interest is a section of the entire image that shall be used by the element for its auto algorithm.
Per default the region equals the entire image unless the user defines these values.

.. _tcamdutils:

tcamdutils
##########

Closed source optional transformation and interpretation filter.
Allows the transformation of bayer 12-bit and 16-bit formats to BGRx 64-Bit.
Implements features like HDR.
For more information read `the documentation <https://www.theimagingsource.com/documentation/tiscameradutils/>`_

.. note::
   When using tiscamera-dutils with tcambin a version check is undertaken.
   tiscamera and tiscamera-dutils are version locked, meaning their major.minor version have to match.
   If a mismatch is detected, tcambin will disable the usage of the tcamdutils element and
   notify you with a GStreamer warning log message and a GstBus message.
   This can be overwritten by manually setting `use-dutils` to `true`.

.. _tcambiteater:

tcambiteater
############

Removed with tiscamera 0.13.0.
Functionality is now included in tiscamera-dutils

.. _tcambin:

tcambin
#######

Wrapper around all the previous elements, allowing for an easy all-in-one handling.
The tcambin will prefer bayer 8-bit over bayer 12/16-bit. Currently tcamdutils are required
for a correct conversion of these formats. Since tcamdutils are an optional module its existence
can not be expected. To ensure identical behavior whether or not tcamdutils are installed, bayer 8-bit will be preferred unless the user explicitly specifies bayer 12/16-bit for the source through the property 'device-caps'. The selected caps for the internal tcamscr will be propagated as a gstbus message with the prefix "Working with src caps: ".
The offered caps are the sum of unfiltered camera caps and caps that will be available through conversion elements like `bayer2rgb`.

The format that can always be expected to work is `BGRx`. All other formats depend on the used device.

.. note::
   When using tiscamera-dutils with tcambin a version check is undertaken.
   tiscamera and tiscamera-dutils are version locked, meaning their major.minor version have to match.
   If a mismatch is detected, tcambin will disable the usage of the tcamdutils element and

    tcamsrc -> capsfilter -> tcamautoexposure -> tcamwhitebalance -> bayer2rgb

    tcamsrc -> capsfilter -> tcamdutils

    tcamsrc -> capsfilter -> jpegdec

    tcamsrc -> capsfilter

Should the selected camera offer focus properties the element :any:`tcamautofocus` will also be included.

Elements that offer auto algorithms (auto exposure/focus) will only be included when the camera itself does not offer these functions.
